title: Domain-Adversial Training of Neural Network
---

Domain-Adversial is a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions.The hypothesis is, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains.
